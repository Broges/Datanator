# Datanator

This project involves a ficticous café, called **Infinity Café**.

## Live presentation

Me and my team gave a live presentation and demonstration of this product, with extensive details and Q&A from real professionals.
I ***HIGHLY*** recommend viewing the presentation instead of reading this readme.
Here is the presentation:

## Scenario

**Infinity Café** has over 100 branches across the UK, and had several data-related issues:
- Data from branches was sent infrequently (monthly)
- Data was not clean
- Data for branches was not accessible to other branches
- Data was not consolidated in one place
- No error handling or logs
- No useful insights could be made from data

With these issues in mind, my team with 6 people including myself, had 3 weeks to tackle all of these issues on behalf of the stakeholder. The resulting product was labelled as *Datanator*.

## Technical Info

- Lambda
- S3
- Redshift
- SQS
