# Datanator

This project involves a ficticous café, called Infinity Café.

Infinity Café has over 100 branches across the UK, and had several data-related issues:
    -Data from branches was sent infrequently (monthly)
    -Data was not clean
    -Data for branches was not accessible to other branches
    -Data was not consolidated in one place
    -No error handling or logs
    -No useful insights could be made from data

With these issues in mind, my team with 6 people including myself, had 3 weeks to tackle all of these issues on behalf of the stakeholder. The resulting product was labelled as 'Datanator;.

Datanator utilizes a wide array of AWS services and more:
    -Lambda
    -S3
    -Redshift
    -SQS
    -Quicksight
    -Serverless
    -Docker
